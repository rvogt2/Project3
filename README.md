# Project 3, REACT to-do list app
this app is a class project meant to take a look at REACT, allowing users to fill in forms to populate a dynamic list.
<h3>All you need to do to use it as of writing is</h3>
<ul>
<li> type in to the field and submit using the button</li>
<li> once certain things are fully complete, you can click a button to fully strike them out</li>
</ul>
all that was used was REACT, REACT.DOM, and by association HTML/CSS.
<h4>Ways to improve</h4>
<li>Validation for ensuring that the input doesnt match another input</li>
<li>Functionality to sign up or at least have a set sign in feature with one set up user</li>
<li>Figure out how to style the Layout/Routes</li>
