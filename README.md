# Project 3, REACT to-do list app
this app is a class project meant to take a look at REACT, allowing users to fill in forms to populate a dynamic list.
<h3>All you need to do to use it as of writing is</h3>
- type in to the field and submit using the button
- once certain things are fully complete, you can click a button to fully strike them out
- 
all that was used was REACT, REACT.DOM, and by association HTML/CSS.
